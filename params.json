{"name":"Strapdown.js @ GitHub.com/Naereen","tagline":"StrapDown.js is an awesome javascript tool to quickly publish nice-looking web-pages in pure Markdown, with no server side compilation.","body":"# StrapDown.js\r\n[StrapDown.js](http://lbesson.bitbucket.org/md/index.html) is an awesome web script to write nice-looking webpages in pure Markdown, with no server side compilation.\r\n\r\n## More details\r\nMore details on [http://lbesson.bitbucket.org/md/index.html](http://lbesson.bitbucket.org/md/index.html), with examples, explanations and even more!\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n**StrapDown.js** is already pretty advanced, as you can see by yourself with this very page (powered by StrapDown.js of course).\r\n\r\n 1. *Directly write your documents in Markdown*, and let the browser do the boring *compilation* steps,\r\n 2. no need for CSS, theming or painful styling: *StrapDown.js* is already *friggin' beautiful*, and *responsive*,\r\n 3. *quick* and *secure*, thanks to *GitHub* and their great SSL support. Note : You can also use [https://cdn.rawgit.com/Naereen/StrapDown.js/master/strapdown.min.js](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Naereen/StrapDown.js/master/strapdown.min.js) to load the script from a quick and secure (HTTPS-aware) CDN.\r\n 4. comes with many examples: <a href=\"example1.html\" title=\"Example 1\">first</a>, <a href=\"example2.html\" title=\"Example 2\">second</a>, <a href=\"example3.html\" title=\"Example 3\">third</a>, <a href=\"example4.html\" title=\"Example 4\">4th</a>, <a href=\"example5.html\" title=\"Example 5\">5th</a>, <a href=\"example6.html\" title=\"Example 6\">6th</a>, <a href=\"example7.html\" title=\"Example 7\">7th</a>...\r\n 5. an almost perfect support for *text-only* browsers (as w3m, links, or elinks): *pure Markdown* is simpler to read than complicated HTML full of javascript, images (or worse),\r\n 6. no external dependencies other than itself (and [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) if you want to include it),\r\n 7. no spying, no logging, no external leaking of your pages (and [Google Analytics with a 1px beacon image](http://perso.crans.org/besson/beacon.html) can be included with an option,\r\n 8. an excellent support of [*MathJax*](http://www.mathjax.org/), as shown in [this example](example3.html) or [that one](example5.html),\r\n 9. and, the last but not the least, an *experimental* embedding of the awesome [SquirtFR](http://lbesson.bitbucket.org/squirt) bookmarklet to read *as quickly as Lucky Luke*.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Drawbacks?\r\nBut there is also have a few things you need to know before using it:\r\n\r\n 1. It might get slow for *very long* pages, even if a **3000-line** document is handled very well and quickl ([you can test by yourself with this long document](3000.html)),\r\n 2. a reduced support for browsers *without javascript* or *with javascript disabled* (the pages are still readable, but really *ugly*),\r\n 3. hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and served by [rawgit](https://rawgit.com), which are wonderful but *might* not be always available.\r\n\r\n## Concretely\r\nConcretely, GitHub is [always](http://status.github.com/) *up*, *secured* and *quick* (oooh, and it is also awesome, completely free, and awesome too). Yeah, *is it so awesome* that I had to say it *twice*, you read it correctly!\r\n\r\nBut if you prefer, feel free to download the project (with [StrapDown.js.zip](https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/lbesson.bitbucket.org/downloads/StrapDown.js.zip)) and upload it somewhere on your own server, or locally on your machine.\r\n\r\nAs the script is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Naereen/StrapDown.js/), it can be loaded *quickly* and *securely* from [cdn.rawgit.com](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Naereen/StrapDown.js/master/strapdown.min.js): [https://cdn.rawgit.com/Naereen/StrapDown.js/master/strapdown.min.js](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Naereen/StrapDown.js/master/strapdown.min.js)!\r\n\r\n> ### A quick \"thank you\" to the [initial project](https://github.com/arturadib/strapdown/)\r\n> My version of StrapDown.js is a fork of [strapdownjs.com](http://strapdownjs.com), a cool project that [kinda seems dead by now](https://github.com/arturadib/strapdown/graphs/contributors).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n### Here is a first demo:\r\n![First demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Naereen/StrapDown.js/master/demo1.png \"First lines of the index.html page\")\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### [This page](http://lbesson.bitbucket.org/md/index.html) explains how to use StrapDown.js:\r\n![Second demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Naereen/StrapDown.js/master/demo2.png \"Demo of the demo!\")\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### There is also many [different themes](https://github.com/Naereen/StrapDown.js/tree/master/themes/):\r\n![Third demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Naereen/StrapDown.js/master/demo3.png \"Small example with the Cyborg theme\")\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### StrapDown.js supports [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/), and it's really easy to use!\r\n![Forth demo](demo4.png \"First lines of the index.html page\")\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### StrapDown.js also supports [MarkDown tables](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#tables):\r\n![Fifth demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Naereen/StrapDown.js/master/demo5.png \"First lines of the index.html page\")\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### And as any web-based document, a StrapDown.js powered HTML page can include any Javascript script, like this example which shows a research bar for a table: \r\n![Sixth demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Naereen/StrapDown.js/master/demo6.png \"First lines of the index.html page\")\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n# About\r\n### Hacked by [Lilian Besson](https://github.com/Naereen) (Naereen).\r\n\r\n### Languages\r\n - [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript),\r\n - [HTML 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [CSS 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets).\r\n\r\n### License\r\nThis project is released under the **MIT license**, for more details,\r\ntake a look at the [LICENSE](http://lbesson.mit-license.org/) file in the source.\r\n","google":"UA-38514290-17","note":"Don't delete this file!
